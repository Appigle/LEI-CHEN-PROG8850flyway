### Database Migration Tools – Analysis & CI/CD Integration

---

#### **1.1 Tool Overview and Comparison**

##### **Flyway**

Flyway is an open-source database migration tool focused on simplicity and reliability. It follows a versioned migration approach using SQL or Java-based scripts and is popular for managing database changes across multiple environments. Flyway integrates seamlessly into CI/CD pipelines.

##### **Microsoft Entity Framework Core (EF Core)**

EF Core is a modern, open-source Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) from Microsoft, designed for .NET developers. In addition to mapping database tables to C# classes, EF Core provides powerful migration capabilities via code-based, model-driven migrations.

##### **Comparison Table**

| Criteria               | Flyway                                                              | EF Core                                                                       |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Ease of Use            | Simple setup; intuitive for DBAs and DevOps teams                   | Developer-friendly for .NET projects; steep learning curve for non-.NET users |
| Integration with CI/CD | Native support in CLI; plugins for build tools                      | Tight integration with .NET pipelines (e.g., Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions)    |
| Supported Databases    | Broad support including PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, etc. | Limited to supported providers (SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, etc.)  |

#### **1.2 Integration Strategy for CI/CD Pipelines**

To integrate both Flyway and EF Core into a CI/CD pipeline.

##### **CI/CD Pipeline Automation Steps**

Using a platform like GitHub Actions or Jenkins:

1. **Pre-Commit (Dev):**
   - Developers run `dotnet ef migrations add` to create new migration classes.
   - `dotnet ef migrations script` is used to generate SQL migration files.
   - Files are committed to the repository under a `migrations` directory.
2. **CI Pipeline (Testing/Staging):**

   - On every merge or pull request:

     - Run unit tests and integration tests using EF Core in the test DB.
     - Validate and apply Flyway migration scripts using `flyway migrate` against the staging DB.
     - Use `flyway validate` to ensure migration history is consistent.

3. **CD Pipeline (Prod):**
   - Once approved, run Flyway commands in the deploy stage to apply SQL migrations to production.
   - Use `flyway info` for audit and traceability.
   - Enable backup and pre-checks before applying changes.

##### **Versioning and Rollback**

- **Versioning:**
  Adopt a semantic versioning scheme for migration filenames (e.g., `V1.2__add_orders_table.sql`). EF Core migration timestamps should be clearly documented and mapped to Flyway versions.

- **Rollback:**
  For EF Core, maintain explicit `Down()` methods in migration classes. For Flyway, optionally implement undo scripts (`U1.2__remove_orders_table.sql`) where feasible. Backup production databases before applying irreversible changes.

This hybrid strategy uses EF Core for developer productivity and model-driven migration generation, while utilizing Flyway’s strengths in deployment control, auditing, and environment consistency.
